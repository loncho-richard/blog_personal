                Every company has its "Cinderella" story about those dark times when it has just started hitting the market. Our story takes its beginning in 2013, at a small office with a few like - minded people and bottomless cups of coffee, that kept us working throughout the night when we have just started building a company with a strong idea. We strived to build a brand that will contribute to the world with useful products that empower people and make their lives easier. We still believe in it today.
